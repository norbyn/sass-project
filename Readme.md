### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

Sass-project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend

And of course sass-project itself is open source with a [public repository][sass-project]
 on GitHub.
